</p>

## Requirements

Make sure to use the [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/) web browser and ensure you have the [Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) installed.

## Installation

To install Amazon Giveaway Bot, click [here](https://github.com/TyGooch/amazon-giveaway-automator/raw/master/amazonGiveawayBot.user.js). If Tampermonkey is correctly installed, you will be asked to add the script to your dashboard. Confirm the installation and start winning some giveaways.

## Usage

Once installed, ensure Tampermonkey is enabled and navigate to [Amazon Giveaways](https://www.amazon.com/ga/giveaways). A control panel will show up as a modal. Provide your 2Captcha API Key then click start. The bot will run inside of the panel until you click stop or leave the page.

## Features

### Captcha Solving
Version 2.0 now has the ability to solve captchas using the 2captcha API. If you aren't a current customer please consider signing up using my [referral link](https://2captcha.com?from=7493321). Once you have a key, paste it into the 2Captcha API Key field in the control panel and you're good to go.
